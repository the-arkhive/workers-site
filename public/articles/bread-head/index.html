<p>This sticker was designed for the <a href="http://wjrh.org/vbb/">Various Breads and Butters</a> podcast hosted by two professors at Lafayette College. They had long had a sticker of a person sitting in a chair, but the head had been replaced with a loaf of bread. We referred to this character as &quot;The Bread Head&quot;. I took this shameless poaching of the Grateful Dead, and developed the parody to its fullest extent.

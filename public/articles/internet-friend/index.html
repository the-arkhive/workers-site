<p>I used an <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/">LSTM</a> text generating neural network to teach a computer English using only the messages I had sent prior to downloading the data from, and then deleting, my Facebook account. Needless to say, the computer did not learn very intelligible English. It did however, learn phonemes, which are sounds with meaning, almost like syllables, but even shorter, like the phonetic breakdown of words. I plan on revisiting this to make it a little more interactive, like being able to talk to myself, but only the version of me that was on Facebook.</p>

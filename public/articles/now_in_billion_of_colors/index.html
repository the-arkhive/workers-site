<p>An internet-based project currently taking the form of performance art, this piece is a collaboration with <a href="http://clarkaddis.com/">Clark Addis</a>. We are posting a color a day, iterating through the RGB color spectrum. Long term goals are to automate the process and start a longer version that could theoretically display 16,777,216 (we know that is less than a billion) colors, which would run for almost 46,000 years.

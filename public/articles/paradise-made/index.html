<p>I was inspired by John Miltonâ€™s <em>Paradise Lost</em> to make a comic book with no words that explores the morality, utility, and vanity of the characters in the book and, by extension, all of humanity. The image displayed below is a PNG and thus subject to compression, for the raw image in full resolution with very little compression please click <a href="https://github.com/thomas-williams/portfolio/blob/master/pictures/paradise_made/milton_comic_cover.tif?raw=true">HERE</a>

<p>Since developing this cover image I have done some test screen printing of it while I work on the inside of the book. The greyscale halftone black ink layer is below. This looks very similar, but if you open the raw files and zoom in you can see that the one below is made up of different sized black dots. The density of those dots when you zoom back out results in all the different shades of grey needed to create the image.

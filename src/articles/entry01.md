## TESTING Day Blind Stars
### Summer, 2016

I've always loved stars. For me, being able to see stars at night was a factor when picking out colleges. Inspired by the text of *The Peace of Wild Things* by Wendell Berry I wanted to make a peace of my own that celebrated the night time. Starting with the stippled image I inverted the colors to produce the final image. This very much relates to the multiple inversion of an image required by the screen printing process, as well as positive and negative sculpts and casts, marking the start of a theme I have carried forward into much of my work.

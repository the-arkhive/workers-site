## Bread Head
### Fall, 2016

This sticker was designed for the [Various Breads and Butters](http://wjrh.org/vbb/) podcast hosted by two professors at Lafayette College. They had long had a sticker of a person sitting in a chair, but the head had been replaced with a loaf of bread. We referred to this character as "The Bread Head". I took this shameless poaching of the Grateful Dead, and developed the parody to its fullest extent.

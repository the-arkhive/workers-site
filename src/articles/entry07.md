## Portrait of an Artist as a Young Engineer
### Fall, 2017

#### Installation
This project started with a romanticized vision of my return to art after spending 2.5 years in engineering. After some initial critiques and chatting with visiting artists, I settled on this idea of taking that core symbol of my favorite childhood toy, the 2x4 LEGO brick, and experimenting with the construction of it. I had seen [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2O7vyKnYfo) video at some point, and had been playing with silicone, so I decided I wanted to make a “flesh brick” &mdash; a LEGO fetus if you will. A soft, fleshy, mildly revolting, and definitely infantile brick would endeavor to evoke a sense of the famous coming of age novel by Jame Joyce from which the piece's name is taken. To go along with that, I picked up screen printing to produce books of “Impossible Instructions” to be used with this brick of life. They are blank. I like to let people draw their own conclusions, so I shall leave it there with a description.

#### Pedestal
This is the image used to burn the screen I used to ink directly onto the pedestal of the exhibit. I had just started the process of printing and hand cutting out the letters when I realized it was going to be a tediously slow undertaking. So, I took a risk with my freshly sanded and painted pedestal and tried screen printing right onto the side, and it worked out great.

#### Book Covers
These are the black screen layer only, so where there is black in the image is where ink will be let through the screen.

#### Version 2
Final casting in some SmoothOn Dragon Skin Medium, which is the leading silicone used for ballistics testing, meant to simulate human muscle and flesh.

#### Version 1
First attempt at taking a silicone cast out of a silicone mold &mdash; lots of mold release and SmoothOn Rebound 25.

#### Master Scuplt
The original clay sculpt of the LEGO brick. There is a wooden form in the core to save on some clay, and the final dimensions are 30cm x 15cm x 15cm.

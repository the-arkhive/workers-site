## Paradise Made Poster
### Spring and Summer, 2019

I have been working to incorporate a laser cutter into printmaking at the Experimental Printmaking Institute, and in doing so I hope to produce a poster version of my Paradise Made comic book cover. This is an ongoing process, but some of the progress is shown below, in roughly chronological order.

#### Laser Testing
The whole process started with learning how to use the laser cutter. I very quickly realized I was not getting the quality I expected, so I taught myself how to refocus the laser, and generally gave the whole thing a tune up. After doing that I could begin to work with actual images. The end goal here is to be able to etch plexiglass plates to then ink and print. That being said I did not want to waste much plexi dialing in the settings, so I used paper at first.

This is the final test before I moved on to plexi

#### Moving to Plexi
So once I was comfortable with the laser I began testing on small amounts of plexi. This meant figuring out how I was going to achieve shading once I inked a plate. When giving the laser an image there are many different options of dithering. I made a true gradient in a graphics editor and then applied each of the lasers dithering patterns to it, etched it into a plate, inked it, and printed it.

This is the second test because I also experimented with sanding at this point. A light amount of sanding ended up being the best and the results of that are the image above. I also wasn't totally happy with any of these shading patterns for my purposes, so I went with another method. The last row of the test above is called 'threshold' and activates the laser when a given pixel is a certain shade of grey and above. With this I could define my shading in my graphics editor and then cut my image with threshold and any pixel I want to end up with ink will be cut.

#### Image Testing
After doing the above testing I used a halftone pattern to define shading from the original image, and then cut a small portion of the full image to ink and test. I actually plan on using white ink for this, so the area of the plate I etched with the laser is where the original image has white space.

#### Full Plate
So after all this testing I was ready to cut a full plate. It's not perfect, but it is very usable and serves as a good example of what this process is capable of. The colors of these proofs are inverted from the final piece because I only had a small amount of black paper that would hold up to the white ink, as that ink is very sticky. At the moment the cut is a little too deep, and really holds on to a lot of ink. This in combination with how sticky the white ink is poses a real threat to any type of paper I might use. So the plate will need to be recut, but I am very happy with how these proofs looks.

#### Paper Testing
With a usable plate the next step I needed to tackle was getting black paper. Thus far I had been largely using scraps from the studio for my testing and I wanted to try and keep that going. The studio I have been working in keeps a lot of scrap paper, and recently got a paper pulper. Before getting the pulper working I did some small scale testing making my own paper using a blender and screens.

The 3 large grey pieces were made by mixing Sumi ink into the paper pulp slurry and then forming sheets of varying thickness. The color of these was not dark enough, so I did some small scale tests. The 4 small pieces on the right from top to bottom are: Dry white paper soaked in Sumi ink, pre-soaked white paper in Sumi ink, the grey paper pre-soaked in water them ink, and a dry piece of grey paper soaked in Sumi ink. Of these the best one is the grey paper, pre-soaked and them soaked in ink. The paper pulper is now up and running, so some larger scale tests can be done. The paper pulper is a kit that I helped source a motor for and then wired that motor and mounted it to the rest of the machine. More documentation of this can be found toward the top of the page.

#### Current State
This pretty much concludes where this project is at the moment. Testing and experimenting with paper is currently underway, but once something usable is produced I can begin testing the plate on that paper with white ink. In the meantime I will recut the plate to be a bit less deep, which should improve image quality.

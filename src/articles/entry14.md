## Paper Pulper
### Summer, 2019

As part of my work in the Experimental Printmaking Institute (EPI), I helped assemble and tune a paper pulper as part of ongoing work to make paper for EPI's uses and my own projects. The pulper came as a kit from [Mark Lander](http://marklander.org/hollander-beaters/). It needed assembly as well as some additional parts. The kit did not come with a motor, but included specifications for the DC motor required. EPI sourced [this](LINK) motor that would need to be wired and mounted to the pulper.

It was fairly simple to splice a cord onto the motor and it was temporarily mounted to the board the pulper would live on, and later fully installed directly on the machine. There is a small clip of the machine in action, and hopefully I will have pictures of results at some point.
